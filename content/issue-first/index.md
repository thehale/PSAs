Thanks for your interest in using open-source software! You're probably here
because a project linked to this page.

Here's what the author(s) of that project want you to know:
 - You are welcome to use the code! It's exciting that you find it useful.
 - This project asks that you open an issue _before_ submitting any pull requests. Always use the appropriate issue template/form, if provided.
   - If you want a new feature, write an issue to propose the idea.
   - If you find a bug, open an issue with detailed reproduction steps.
   - If you find a security flaw, share a working reproduction per the
     project's security policies (e.g. SECURITY.md).
 - Opening an issue first helps the project stay organized around a shared
   vision. It also avoids miscommunications and hurt feelings that can 
   result from needing to reject a PR that isn't the right fit.
 - The code is open-source. Feel free to make a fork to resolve any
   shortcomings for your needs.
 - Remember to follow the terms in the project's license.
